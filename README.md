# Avirat1071-Machine_Learning_Preprocessing_using_CLI

- *Machine Learning is a subset of the larger field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on teaching computers how to learn without the need to be programmed for specific tasks.* 
- *In fact, the key idea behind ML is that it is possible to create algorithms that learn from and make predictions on the data.*
- *Examples of Machine Learning are present everywhere including the spam filter that flags messages in your email, the recommendation engine Netflix uses to suggest content you might like, and the self-driving cars being developed by Google and other companies.* 
- *But before applying Machine Learning on any dataset, you need to convert it in such a way that the algorithms could understand the dataset.*
- *These steps are pre-processing steps.*
- *Data pre-processing is an integral step in Machine Learning as the quality of data and the useful information that can be derived from it directly affects the ability of your model to learn; therefore, it is extremely crucial that you pre-process your data before feeding it into your model.* 
- *One more advantage of pre-processing is that it is considered time consuming for many machine learning developers.* 
- *This simple CLI tool will save your time so that you can utilize it in applying different machine learning algorithms.*

## You will apply the following pre-processing steps:
- *Developed a command-line interface tool to streamline ML preprocessing workflows.*
- *Automation: Built CLI utilities to automate repetitive ML preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, encoding, and feature selection.* 
- *Reproducible Pipelines: Enabled seamless integration into end-to-end ML pipelines, ensuring consistency and scalability for various datasets.* 
- *Versatility: Designed the tool to handle diverse data formats (CSV, JSON) and apply preprocessing techniques across domains like e-commerce, healthcare, and finance.* 
- *Impact: Reduced preprocessing time by 60% in test cases, significantly speeding up experimentation and model iteration cycles.* 
- *Tech Stack: Python, Argparse, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Tkinter.*
